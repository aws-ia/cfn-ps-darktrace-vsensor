image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture (when 2+ Availability Zones are used).
* A virtual private network (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access to Darktrace vSensor instances.
* In the private subnets:
** An Auto Scaling group of Darktrace vSensor probes hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. 
* VPC traffic mirroring to send mirrored traffic to a Network Load Balancer.
* A Network Load Balancer to distribute monitored VPC traffic to Darktrace vSensor instances.
* An Amazon S3 bucket to store packets captured by Darktrace vSensor.
* Amazon CloudWatch to provide logs to collect metrics from Darktrace vSensor EC2 instances.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
